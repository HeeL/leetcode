# leetcode

It's a collection of my leetcode solutions. Each directory is a separate challenge, which contains README with description of a problem and a corresponding code with a solution. Sometimes there are multiple alternative solutions. For convenience reasons tests are included in implementation file, so to check it you can run `node` for particular example and see the output.

List of challenges and solutions:

* [First Missing Positive](./first-missing-positive/)
* [Summary Ranges](./summary-ranges/)
* [Generate Parentheses](./generate-parentheses/)
* [Two Sum](./two-sum/)
